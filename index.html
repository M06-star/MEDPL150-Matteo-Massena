    <p>Matteo Massena: a Trans Brooklyn native, Emerging Media Major and Computer Science Minor student. I'm a Hunter student who has a passion for designing and technology. My dream is becoming a software developer and graphic designer. Media for me is a gateway for interaction and making a statement about yourself, along with making connections with people around you. In this class, I want to learn design elements within html and css along to make a website more in my style. I hope this class will bring out more of my creativeness and give me the push to challenge myself more. </p>
