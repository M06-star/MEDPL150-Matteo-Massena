   <h1>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times: Reading</h1>
<p>  Hennigan's warnings about the growing threat of nuclear war seem alarming, especially at a time of heightened global tensions and strategic uncertainty. The central idea is obvious but important. That is, we no longer live in a world where nuclear war seems unlikely or remote. On the contrary, the risk increases.What is striking is how much the geopolitical situation has changed. Hennigan argues that post-Cold War hopes for gradual nuclear disarmament and durable deterrence have been undermined. All major nuclear powers are modernizing their arsenals. At the same time, traditional barriers that once constrained proliferation and minimized miscalculation are weakening or disappearing. The sense of security that the world's nuclear weapons will remain under control - the belief that the world's nuclear weapons will remain under control - is fading. It's not just about accumulating more weapons, it's about increasing instability: more states, more modern weapons, more ambiguous doctrine. 
Even tactical or “small” nuclear weapons can set off a chain of escalation that can lead to catastrophe. This makes Mr. Hennigan's call for renewed national awareness, policy debate, and concrete action both urgent and necessary. He doesn't just warn. He calls for structural safeguards such as clearer decision-making procedures, limits on the president's ability to unilaterally launch nuclear weapons, a revamp of arms control diplomacy, and a "dual lock" or multilateral oversight mechanism that would raise the threshold for use. This is a sobering reminder that the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons is not a relic of the past. It's still very real and in some ways more dangerous.
This is very alarming. Living with this possibility carries psychological weight. So the idea is that what we thought was stable and contained is falling apart. This forces us to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions. Are people and societies ready for this danger? Can democratic institutions muster enough resolve and vision to confront a threat that, if miscalculated, leaves no possibility of recovery? But the very fact that Hennigan is writing, and that we are reading, points to a silver lining of public discussion. For too long, nuclear risks risk appearing abstract or “academic”, especially to those outside military and diplomatic circles. Hennigan is helping bring the issue back to reality by bringing it back into the public eye. For a democracy to respond, citizens need to be aware of and consider these risks.
What struck me further was the fragility of the ``rules of the game.'' Deterrence structures, arms control structures, first use taboos, none of these are guaranteed forever. Their defeat was not only a political failure. This will be a new definition of global risk. This vulnerability makes the choices of leaders, and society, even more important. Finally, reading his article made me think about responsibility, our collective responsibility. This is not just a job for diplomats, generals, and politicians. If we care about the future of humanity and the preservation of what we take for granted - stability, peace, civilization itself - this conversation requires all of us to be a part of it. Public pressure, awareness, advocacy and moral urgency are critical.
