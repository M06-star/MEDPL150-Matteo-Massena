    <h1>In Plato's Cave Reading</h1>

    <p>Here is the reading for Homework 2: In the first chapter of "On Photography," Susan Sontag reflects the camera not only as a device for recording moments, but also as a tool that shapes the way we see and interpret the world. Even before the growth of the smartphone and digital age, she realized that this should take a picture of something to apply for it, give meaning, and distribute it from the direct experiences of life. Today, this reflex is even more urgent. Cameras are everywhere, and image production is not only constantly widespread. We document everything. The world crisis leads to the fact that we were there for lunch. but why? And how does that affect you as a media creator?

For me, capturing images is a way of understanding. I don't always take photos to record my memories - I take them to explore them to create subjects to understand emotions and spaces. Photos allow me to slow down what's in front of me and analyze it. Whether it's a person from the corner of the street or a sample of light, the camera helps me see what I can lose sight of. Similarly, with graphics and illustration creation, photography offers a visual language to express abstract concepts that cannot be captured at all times. Combining text and images, I can add additional, tone, and comments - create richer narration.

When I go to 10 projects in this course, I would like to treat them not as isolated tasks, but as heads of Visual Journal. I'm interested in the way visual voices develop between tools and formats. Perhaps the project is primarily based on photography, while the other is based on illustrations or printing. But they can talk to each other - perhaps through repeated patterns, general subjects, or stylistic choices. I would like to study ideas of place, identity, observation, digital saturation, and intimacy. Each project can become an investigation, and together they can form a united comment.

If I now introduce our world visually, I will focus on contrast, connections and disconnection, noise and silence, presence and absence. We live in a paradoxical period where we are overconditioned in digital form, but we often feel alone. A series of images can display overflowing channels on a social network, except for physical vacuum images. This is a kind of diptic that shows two realities. Alternatively, you can use illustrations and text to create a layer with a layer that represents an overload of information you encounter every day, and take it to find meaning.

Ultimately, I believe that creating images is the responsibility. Each frame, each brand, each pixel contributes to the story of our time. As a media outlet, I need to decide which stories I should tell, what truths I want to reflect, and how my visual effects will affect those who see them. It's not just a matter of aesthetics, it's also a matter of influence. Sontag warns that photography is an act of power. Over the course of this course I would like to use this power with intention and conscience.
