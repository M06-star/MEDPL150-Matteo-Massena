    <h1>In PLato's Cave Reading</h1>

    <p>Here is the reading for Homework 2: In the opening chapter of On Photography, Susan Sontag reflects on the camera not just as a device for recording moments, but as a tool that shapes how we see and interpret the world. Even before the rise of smartphones and the digital age, she understood that to photograph something was to claim it, to give it importance, and to distance oneself from the direct experience of life. Today, this reflection is even more urgent. Cameras are everywhere, and image-making is not just common—it’s constant. We document everything from global crises to what we had for lunch. But why? And how does this affect us as media creators?

For me, capturing images is a way of understanding. I don’t always take photos to preserve memory—I take them to explore, to frame a subject, to make sense of emotion or space. Photography allows me to slow down and analyze what’s in front of me. Whether it’s a person, a street corner, or a pattern of light, the camera helps me see what I might otherwise overlook. Similarly, creating graphics and illustrations gives me a visual language to express abstract concepts that photography can’t always capture. With text and image combined, I can layer meaning, tone, and commentary—building a richer narrative.

As I approach the ten projects in this course, I want to treat them not as isolated tasks, but as chapters in a visual journal. I’m interested in how my visual voice will evolve across tools and formats. Maybe one project leans heavily into photography while another is built from illustration or typography. Still, they can talk to each other—maybe through recurring motifs, shared themes, or stylistic choices. I want to explore ideas of place, identity, surveillance, digital saturation, and intimacy. Each project can be an investigation, and together, they can form a cohesive commentary.

If I were to represent our world visually right now, I’d focus on contrast: connection and disconnection, noise and silence, presence and absence. We live in a paradoxical time where we’re hyperconnected digitally but often feel alone. A series of images could show crowded social media feeds beside images of physical emptiness—a kind of diptych showing both realities. Or, using illustration and text, I could create layered posters that represent the overload of information we face daily and how we sift through it to find meaning. </p>

Ultimately, I believe image-making is a responsibility. Each frame, each mark, each pixel contributes to the narrative of our time. As a media maker, I have to decide what stories are worth telling, what truths I want to reflect, and how my visuals affect those who view them. It’s not just about aesthetics—it’s about impact. Sontag warns us that taking a photo is an act of power; as I move through this course, I want to use that power with intention and awareness.</p>
