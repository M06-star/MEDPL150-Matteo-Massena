    <h1>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster Reading</h1>

    <p>Nesrina Malik's essay warns us of the cheap chunks of "AI drainage" image flow: the cheap chunks of AI that permeates every corner of the visual experience and distorts the perception of reality. She argues that this torrent in images does not only deflect us - it is a distortion of our counting, confidence, and sense of truth.
In our daily lives, we now live in two parallel visual flows. One of them is "real" photography, documentary executives, images of crisis and changes. The other is artificial. Fantastic, caricatures, idealisation, often less human supervision. What Malik calls "AI Sols" ranges from harmless or stupid paintings to surrealistic landscapes, to viral memes - politically armed images. The combined effect lies in the fact that the boundaries of truth are manipulated and simple entertainment becomes unstable.
This instability has consequences. First, there is desensitization. When each image competes for attention - some kind of absurd, emotionally loaded - our visual emotions are dull. The real fear is no longer quite astounding. They fuse with background noise. Malik points out that images of violence, human suffering, or political conflict can be felt as too realistic and unrealistic.
Secondly, propaganda has a dimension. A-war is an ideal tool for ideological production because it can be produced at a minimum cost and is therefore not responsible. Malik points out that generative AI is structurally conservative - its educational data reflects past visual culture bias, which often leads to reinforcing white supporters of dominance, patriarchy, or nostalgic fantasy. It gives an example of the image of "commercial women" praised by the flow of algorithms, or an example of a shortage of right-wing political fantasies. When distortion is not possible, the narrative of disagreement becomes more difficult to maintain.

Third, and perhaps the most insidious, is the paralysis of the engine. We risk entering a state of collective passivity. Not because we are ignorant, but because we are overloaded. If we can't trust what we see - and if everything happens as a sight - how do we act significantly? Malik creates it like Lubov in disaster. It's not indifferent, but promoted through the mist I sold. Climate, inequality, war, human rights crises - everything requires a clear, moral emergency, a collective response. But when our emotions are paralyzed, urgency becomes an aesthetic, not a call to action. 
It feels a kind of ghost of helplessness. How to resist when distortion comes from all sides? Still, we have to. New media constructed for generative interventions - developmental techniques are required. Detection, Filigren, original follow-up: Transparency is required. The platform must be responsible not only for censoring the box, but also for how its design enhances the visual effects of the operation. Scientists, artists and institutions should promote and be confident in ambiguity, complexity and imperfections towards the true human being. In short, the AI ​​gradient is not only technical, but also a democratic challenge. When a fictional aesthetic allows reality to colonize, we risk implying that it means not only that we believe, but generally, that we believe. Malik's essay is an incredible call. In an era of algorithmic wars, images can clearly be the first act of resistance.
