<p>The nightmare horror image was designed to evoke feelings of fear and unease through a surreal blend of dark, horror visuals. Using multiple source images from Pinterest: such as a black background, red glowing eyes, red blood drips, and a demon figure. Photoshop’s layer masking allowed precise control over how each element merged into the composition. Additional use of opacity adjustments, burn and dodge tools, and custom brushes enhanced the textures and shadows, giving the final image a nightmare horror aesthetic.
In contrast, the transgender improvement image was created to symbolize personal transformation, identity, and empowerment. Several backgrounds and things I love where found on Pinterest and combined—such as the use of yellow as positivity, a tattoo sketch of FtM transition scars, and a greek statue. By utilizing Photoshop masking, key parts of each image were isolated, like the body and statue, and blended seamlessly using layer blending modes such as Overlay and Screen. The flag and the use of yellow was put in a sense of  the tone and evoke a feeling of warmth, self-love, and growth. </p>
